# Prime-Finder
Program for finding primes in Haskell.
A list of primes is stored, the command "List" prints the current list.
"List" followed by a number updates the list (searching for primes up to that number) and displays it.
"Bool" followed by a number updates the list in the same way and displays True or False depending on whether or not the number is in the resulting list.
